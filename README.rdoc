= Overview

SecureString is a special string subclass that provides two pieces of
functionality that can be used individually:

* Byte string support:  Although a string can already contain bytes, this makes
  it easier to view and work with strings holding binary data, including
  conversion to/from raw hex or Base64 encoded values.
* Secure string support: Easy methods for RSA encryption, AES encoding, and
  SHA/MD5 digest hashing, of the data in the strings.
